## Motivation

As I am looking to shift across from my current role as an ETL/Data Engineer and into a Data Science role in the near future I was curious to get an idea of what the UK Data Science job market looks like at the moment.

I wanted to answer three key questions
* What are the most requested skills/technologies for Data Scientist positions?
* Where are Data Scientist roles located across the UK?
* Do roles tend to be permanent or contract/temporary roles

There are no easily obtainable data on current roles so I decided to write a web scraper to gather this myself and analyse to answer my questions.

The process and findings are documented in the jupyter notebook uk-data-science-job-analysis.ipynb

## Requirements

The notebook makes use of several libraries which can be found in Requirements.txt in this repo. This file can be used with pip to install this requirements e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt

## Files

requirements.txt:
    pip requirements file listing packages needed by the jupyter notebook

uk-data-science-job-analysis.ipynb:
    jupyter notebook containing the code for the web scraper, data pre-processing/cleaning and data analysis/visualisations
